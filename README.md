# Simple LSTM
LSTM stands for long short-term memory networks, used in the field of Deep Learning. It is a variety of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that are capable of learning long-term dependencies, especially in sequence prediction problems.
 
In this program, I built a  simple  LSTM to predict complete sentences. 
As like google search suggestion. 
Though for my machine's limitations, I train with my little dataset which is ta1.txt . To get a better result, you should use a large text corpus. 

Some examples of our test - 
Input -> I
Output -> drink rice
I drink rice was not in our dataset. That means the model learned something
